# LiveApp MVP ðŸ”´

![LiveApp logo](resources/logo/logo-128x.png)

This application allows to read the discord chat of some channel, using [WidgetBot](https://widgetbot.io/) while doing other things. \
In other words, it is an *always on top* application, which allows to do some other things like programming a thing in an IntelliJ-based IDE but to see the chat simultaneously.

**The primary purpose of this app is to be used while streaming live, on discord!**

## WARNING!

This application is **heavy**: because of ElectronJS which is basically a full browser, it weighs around 160MB. \
It has originally been made in less than an hour, to get **a quick MVP**.
